NodeJSGallery
=============

A simple image gallery that uses node-js.

Overview
========

This application is the first (and hopefully not the last) node-js application i've built. It stores all of the 
mages in the views/upload folder, and on page load, retrieves them via ajax and displays them on the front page. 
ou can put whatever images you want in this directory and they should show up (let me know if they don't!).

Installation
============

Simply download all of the files to a directory, cd to the root directory and run `node protected/run.js`

Libraries & Modules
===================
* jQuery
* jQuery-ui
* KnockoutJS
* Lightbox 2
* simple-mime
* formidable
